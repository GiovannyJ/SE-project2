            QUERY STRINGS :: id, fname, lname, fullname, email, username, order
        DONE posts ->  will grab all posts (limit by certain number to reduce bottle neck)
            QUERY STRING :: id, title, genre, authorID, numUp, numDown, date, order
        DONE posts/fullcontext -> grabs all info from post
            QUERY STRINGS :: postId, authorID, fullname, username, title, numUp, numDown, genre, date, order
